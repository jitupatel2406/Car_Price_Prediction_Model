# Car_Price_Prediction_Model
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Model

This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, etc.

## 🏗️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
4. **Model Building**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - XGBoost  
5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score  
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
7. **Model Deployment** *(Optional)*
